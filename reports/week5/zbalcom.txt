From last week:
"For this upcoming week, my goal will be to learn the Haxe language and tools associated with it, specifically those used to convert our code base from its previous language, ActionScript. In this way I hope to become better-equipped to deal with some of the more unusual bugs and issues that have presented themselves in our Haxe code base, and fix a reasonable percentage of dependency and syntax errors caused by the converter. A “reasonable percentage” is to be determined, but as a preliminary estimate, I hope to have the PipeJam code bug-free (with the help of my team) in no more than two weeks, maximum."

This week I have indeed taken some time to read about Haxe and looked through our code base as I did, so I could focus on the main aspects used in our project. However, I have not made much progress in fixing the bugs in the PipeJam code base, as I have felt as though I do not know where to begin. I had a similar problem last quarter, but I do not intend to do nothing to solve it. I also recognize that my interaction with my team has been fairly minimal.

My goals for this week are twofold: First, I will be meeting with Mike when I can to get some help on past homeworks as well as learning strategies so that I can catch myself up and not fall behind as I did last quarter. Second, I will be meeting with and interacting with my team, both in person and on Slack, more often as I work on fixing the PipeJam codebase (and eventually, adding features to either it or FlowJam). I hope that in these two ways I can feel more confident about my ability in this class and my value on this team, and successfully fix PipeJam (with the help of my teammates) this week.
