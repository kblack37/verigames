# Individual Report (Jake Chiang): Week 3 #


## Progress ##
This week was devoted to establishing a development environment for working on
the project. I downloaded the core existing codebase (which was now cloned to
the team repository) and installed Haxe to begin assisting in fixing errors and
cleaning up the auto-generated ActionScript to Haxe port. I also began reading
through the games' codebases and Haxe documentation to learn the language.

I also looked into setting up Flash so that I could play the existing
ActionScript version of the games, but ran into difficulties since it is
uninstalled from my system and isn't supported in many ways for my current OS
version.


## Goals ##
- Set up VM to run Flash, or find supported version
- Playtest PipeJam/FlowJam
- Resolve compiler errors for Haxe port of the *Jam games.
