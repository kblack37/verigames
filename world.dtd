TODO:

- make edge description optional
- move stub boards to world

================================================================================

Requirements not enforced by the DTD:

  - All boards must be well-formed:
    - There must be an incoming and an outgoing node
    - Each node must have the correct number of connections for its type (see
    Intersection class for details)
    - No node or edge may be connected to a node or edge in another board
    - No board may contain a cycle
    - A SUBBOARD type node must have the same number of inputs and outputs as its
    referent
    - All nodes that have kind SUBBOARD must have a name attribute (and the name
    attribute is meaningless for other kinds of node)

  - Linked chutes:
    - variableIDs that are negative indicate chutes that should not be linked with
    anything -- as such, no negative variableID should be included in a varID-set.
    - All linked chutes (chutes with the same positive variable ID, or linked
    variableIDs) must have the same width and must all be either editable or
    non-editable
    - Every variableID listed in the varID sets must be the variableID of at least
    one edge

  - variableID must be an integer

  - Layout coordinates (x and y) must be reals

================================================================================

Node layout information:

  X and Y coordinates are reals starting at 0. (0,0) is the top left corner.

  Width:

    - MERGE, SPLIT, and NULL_TEST nodes have a width of 2. That is, a node to
    the right of a MERGE at (0,0) must be at (2,0) or to the right.

    - SUBBOARD nodes have width = max(#incoming edges, #outgoing edges)

    - END nodes have a width of 1

  Height:

    - MERGE, SPLIT, START_XXX_BALL, and SUBNETWORK nodes have a height of 2.
    That is, a node below a SPLIT at (0,0) must be at (0,2) or below.

    - INCOMING nodes have a height of 1.

    - Nodes connected by an edge with pinch=true must have an extra y
    coordinate between them.

    - END nodes have a height of 1

================================================================================

Edge layout information:

  Edge layout is given in the form of a list of b-spline control points. The
  number of control points, x, will always be such that (x = 1 (mod 3)).
  Equivalently, (x mod 3) = 1, or x = 1 + 3n, where n is any nonnegative
  integer.

================================================================================

Misc:

  - BALL_SIZE_TEST node:

    - Represents the branching that occurs when the variable represented by
    the input edge is tested against null (or whatever the "large ball" of a
    given type system represents).

    - Upon encountering this node, a small ball will roll to the output edge
    at port "small", which must be the first port, and a large ball will roll
    to the output edge at port "large".

    - The output edge at port "small" must be narrow, and the output edge at
    port "large" must be wide.
