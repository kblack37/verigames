Graphviz has several layout tools. One of them (the one I believe to be best
suited to our needs) -- "dot" -- draws hierarchical graphs, with parent nodes
strictly above child nodes. 

The row of nodes in which a nodes lies is its "rank."
This is roughly how rank works:
The top row of nodes is rank 0 -- these nodes have no parents.
Rank 1 consists only of children of rank 0
Rank 2 consists only of children of ranks 0 and 1
etc.

The Flash game uses coordinates in a different format than Graphviz:

The game uses decimal coordinates with a scale such that most nodes have
roughly single-digit dimensions.

Graphviz uses both inches and points. Points are typographical points, and
there are 72 in an inch.

I'm scaling the Graphviz graph so that 1 game unit = 1 inch.

So, in summary:

1 game unit = 1 inch = 72 points.

Graphviz expresses position in points. The bottom left is the origin, with X
and Y values increasing to the right and up, respectively. The position of a
node refers to its center.

The game expresses position in game units. The top left is the origin, with X
and Y values increasing to the right and down, respectively.
