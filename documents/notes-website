Web support for uploading and downloading code.

In particular, I would like to have a website where a user can:
 * upload a Java program.
 * have a game automatically created (This step is missing so far!  But,
   you should be able to create everything so that this can be plugged in.)
 * play the game
 * download, and/or view at the website, annotated code

I think this will be useful in a few different ways.  

 * Being able to test and visualize our system end-to-end will help us with
   experimentation.  This project could also be the foundation of an
   automated test suite, which we are in significant need of.

 * This will be a great advertising tool, or a way to get people interested
   in our project.  Enabling people to upload their own code and see and
   play the resulting game will be a big draw, I think -- it will increase
   the coolness factor of the project and help people to believe that it is
   real.

There's a bit more to this project than meets the eye.  The straightforward
part requires building a website with forms for uploading, and calling the
game creation code and directing visitors to play the game, and displaying
the code in an attractive way after the game is played.

Even uploading is non-trivial.  We don't want to worry about the security
problems of running an arbitrary Ant file that the user provided, but we'll
want source code for outputting annotations into.
(In addition to uploading, the form would also have a few pre-canned
programs that users could try with the click of a button.)

The project also requires extending the XML game file format, so that there
is a mapping between game elements and program elements (variables, type
parameters, etc.), and then interpreting a solved game into a .jaif file
that can be used to annotate the code.
