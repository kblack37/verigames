No previous week goals

This week I cloned the existing PipeJam/FlowJam code from the
given repository and ran it through the as3hx tool to do most
of the work of updating the code, besides the jobs of fixing
the inevitable errors of that program and then finding replacements
for dependences that haven't been updated to work with Haxe. I then
set up the github repository with this initial code and posted up a
guide on how to install Haxe and its corresponding environment.

In the next week, I plan to work in the code base to fix errors and,
since I've done exactly this kind of work before, help my team members
whenever they're stuck on an issue. We'll also make note to where 
external dependencies are now missing and need to be replaced. The goal
is to, within 2 weeks, have game at least running.
