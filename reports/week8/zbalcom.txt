From last week:
"My goals for this week are simply to be useful. Though I have been there to help make major decisions about the direction we have taken, and I have contributed to the project in some more overarching ways, the amount of actual programming I have done has been minimal. I intend to rectify that this week, especially now that we have a clearer goal in mind (get FlowJam loading assets and running correctly) than we had before (which was simply "Fix it")."

I have to say, though I've had a pretty busy week, I managed to fulfill my goal, to some extent. The three of us besides Autumn have begun the process of refactoring some of the many "god classes" in the project, with a goal of approximating the "entity-component-system" architecture pattern (with Autumn's guidance), which is common in game development. This involves splitting up our respective classes into multiple smaller classes to reduce how interconnected the project's main classes are. I have begun analyzing the functionality in the "Level" class, and will be creating interfaces for my planned classes before I implement them, so my team members can use my interfaces while refactoring their classes, even while mine has yet to be completed. Now that I am actually coding, I feel much more useful to the team.

My goal for this week is to make progress on refactoring Level, ideally completing one or more, if not all of my interfaces, so that my teammates may begin refactoring their classes with respect to mine.
