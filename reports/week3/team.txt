# Team Report: Week 3 #

## Last Week's Goals ##
- Acquire existing codebase
- Set up project development environment
- Re-assess project scope and timeframe projection using our new understanding
  of the codebase


## Progress ##
This week our progress was devoted to moving the existing codebase into an
environment where we could expand and build on it. Team members installed
development environments for Haxe work, and have began acclimating to the new
language and codebase. We also began work on converting the PipeJam and
FlowJam games from ActionScript to Haxe, first by using as3tohaxe as an
automated first pass, and then by manually resolving any remaining compiler
errors. 

Difficulties in the port so far have come primarily from ActionScript
architecture/features that couldn't be directly translated to Haxe and also
dependencies that the Flash version relied on.


## Goals ##
- Finish resolving compilier errors with FlowJam and PipeJam
- Begin work on adding external assets back into the codebase
