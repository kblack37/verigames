            Comments in code (at least in the PL-Side of things) should refer to the
            relevant sections in this document that explain what the code is implementing.  If that section does not
            exist then it should be created. At some point we should generate the appropriate Verigames Javadoc
            in order to link from Manual sections to code as well. <br/>

            <p>
                Early on we discussed two possible ways to handle input parameters to subboard calls, outlined below.
                We had settled on the &#34;Route Through&#34; method but I donâ€™t think we realized that there needs to be some
                change to the game-side behavior to correctly implement this method. <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Open Question:</strong> At the time of this writing there seemed to be a disagreement between
                the PL-Side and Game Side as to what method we should use.  The PL-Side favors &#34;Route Through&#34; and
                the Game-Side favors &#34;Route Around&#34;.

            <h4>Methods</h4>
            <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note:</strong> In both methods below, the declaration board for a method
                will look the same AND the ball-size of each pipe connected to the board&#39;s input will be dependent on
                its pipe&#39;s size.

                        In this method, all input parameters are split and passed to the appropriate inputs but NOT
                        routed out of the board.  The original pipe is then routed around the board and used for
                        subsequent intersections.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        In this method, all input parameters are routed through the input board and the pipes emerging
                        from the subboard are used for subsequent intersections. Furthermore, in the case of polymorphic
                        methods, a ball flowing into the subboard might determine the size of balls flowing out
                        (see Polymorphic Methods section ). <!-- TODO ADD LINK -->

                    <td>
                        We DON&#39;T have to worry about the ball-size behavior when routing a pipe through the board
                        (since no pipe passes entirely through the board).
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        It is more obvious that the subboard may apply some constraint to the pipe, as the pipe being
                        used passed right through the subboard.  The behavior required by this method also
                        provides us Polymorphism for free.

                    <td>
                        The subboard call might impose pinch-points or fixed widths on the input pipe.  While these will
                        be propagated to the original pipe through linking, it might not be obvious to the player
                        that it was the subboard that caused the pipe to be narrowed.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Balls must &#34;flow through&#34; all pipes except the return types (i.e. we need to detect
                        the appropriate ball-size for the output of a method call based on any inputs that
                        flow to that output).  Furthermore, in cases where we detect a ball-size to be polymorphic,
                        the output size of the ball must be the same as the input size.  This means that the ball-size
                        of the pipes in the actual declaration board of a method might be different than those that
                        actually flow through a subboard intersection that represents a call to that method.  This is
                        not the current game-side behavior (at least in Classic).

               <strong>Note:</strong>  Method B (Route Through)  is how the PL Side currently has implemented subboards but this does not
               work with the game side classic implementation.  As a result, some boards are unsolvable without
               buzz-saws at the moment.  Method A (Split/Route Around) would work with the existing game-side
               implementation.

            <p>
                For the given method implementation, a call to that method is diagrammed below for both the
                &#34;Split/Route Around&#34; and &#34;Route Through&#34; methods.

  return two;

             src="images/methods_and_subboards/routingStrategies.png"/>
        <p>
            In method A, since there are no outputs that correspond with the left most pipes (receiver, one, two) there is
            no need to coordinate the output ball size with the input pipe.  However, on the right side (method B) there
            is.  Note that the width of the ports on the method call might be different (larger if there is no conflict)
            then the actual inputs for a given call to the method.
