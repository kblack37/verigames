Hi! Please get your parent or guardian to read this, too!
By playing this game, you agree that:
a) The game can record how you play. We* look at this to learn how to make the game better for other kids.
b) The game is telling us if you have friends who play, too. That way we can see if having friends helps you out with the game. We think it probably does help, but we are not sure.
c) We are sharing how you play with other people on our team. **
d) We are sharing what we learn with others from all over the world! That is how science is done. We have to share so others can learn, too.
e) If you are not playing fair, we can stop you, so be nice.
If you do not want us to see how you are doing, just stop playing. Also have your parent or guardian contact us.
By checking Agree, you agree that a parent or guardian has read this and is letting you play.
