	*.c files

	I've modified these some to take different command-line args, specifically to take a string on the command-line, and to specify an output file for results, both optional. You can still
	call it using maxsatz.exe foo.wcnf. If you are getting seg faults, you might need to raise the limit on the number of vars (tab_variable_size) or clauses (tab_clause_size).

	Or specifically:

	maxsatz.exe [-s] input_instance [-i dirpath]
		-s: treat input instance is string, else as a file.
		-i: output intermediate results to specified directory, else don't output results.
		

To compile: run make, or by using:
	gcc maxsatz.c -o maxsatz.exe
