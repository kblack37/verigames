## Previous week's goals ##
Have every person's part of the code refactored. Once this is done, getting a level up and running
properly should be much easier. (possibly) update the proposal to reflect new goals, if review of
current work necessitates it. May have to consider a different final goal (getting the code base in
a decent enough state).

## What I've done this week ##
Specified and added skeleton code and few implementations of updated engine code. Directed team meeting.
Rewrote parts of proposal.

## Next week's goals ##
Have full top-level engine goal integrated into game and hopefully team members' components as well.
