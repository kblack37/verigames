From last week:
"My goals for this week mostly consist of returning to learning from Autumns commits how to fix common compiler issues, and making my own attempts at fixing some of the problems. Also, in light of the miscommunication regarding compile error tracking, I will be increasingly explicit in my communication with my teammates to ensure that they understand exactly what I am working on. This will hopefully improve team efficiency, as well as my teammates' confidence in my ability to contribute to this project."

This week we did increase communication in some key areas, and we made the decision, as approved by Martin, to abandon attempts to fix PipeJam, as FlowJam is closest to functioning and if we continue to invest time in PipeJam as well, we are unlikely to have the time to add anything interesting and new to either game. It is better to get one game working well than 2 games working well enough. Unfortunately, I was out of town this weekend, and since we finalized our decision on Thursday, I didn't have much time to work on FlowJam. However, this week I will hopefully have more time with less homework in other classes, and no lecture in this class Monday or Wednesday.

My goals for this week are simply to be useful. Though I have been there to help make major decisions about the direction we have taken, and I have contributed to the project in some more overarching ways, the amount of actual programming I have done has been minimal. I intend to rectify that this week, especially now that we have a clearer goal in mind (get FlowJam loading assets and running correctly) than we had before (which was simply "Fix it").
