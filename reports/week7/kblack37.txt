## NOTE ##
Was sick all weekend and Monday 5/7, so collapsing Tuesday 5/8's work into this report as well

## Previous week's goals ##
Now that FlowJam is ACTUALLY free of compiler errors and can demonstrate the solutions to
many of the common compiler errors, I hope to also have PipeJam be in the same state by
next week. Want to finish cleaning up the FlowJam code so it doesn't crash immediately upon launch.
Integrate all the feedback we've gotten on the proposal & the user manual; this will likely
have to be delegated as it's easier to explain than the code errors.

## What I've done this week ##
Cleaned up FlowJam code so that we are able to launch the game and the tutorial level without
any issues, but the tutorial level itself is plagued by display errors (scaling, placement,
etc) to an unplayable extent. Doled out responsibilities for the week to the rest of the team.
Discussed future of the project with the work we have ahead of us.

## Next week's goals ##
Have every person's part of the code refactored. Once this is done, getting a level up and running
properly should be much easier. (possibly) update the proposal to reflect new goals, if review of
current work necessitates it. May have to consider a different final goal (getting the code base in
a decent enough state).
