# Team Report: Week 3 #

## Last Week's Goals ##
- Acquire existing codebase
- Set up project development environment
- Re-assess project scope and timeframe projection using our new understanding
  of the codebase


## Progress ##
- Codebase acquired
- Installed and set up Haxe development environments
- Began converting PipeJam and FlowJam from ActionScript to Haxe
    - First using AS3ToHaxe as an automated first pass
    - Second by manually resolving remaining compiler errors
- Difficulties:
    - Resolving problems caused by ActionScript architecture/features that
      couldn't be directly translated to Haxe
    - Resolving dependencies that the Flash versions relied on


## Goals ##
- Finish resolving compilier errors with FlowJam and PipeJam
- Begin work on adding external assets back into the codebase
