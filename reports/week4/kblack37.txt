## Previous week's goals ##
In the next week, I plan to work in the code base to fix errors and,
since I've done exactly this kind of work before, help my team members
whenever they're stuck on an issue. We'll also make note to where 
external dependencies are now missing and need to be replaced. The goal
is to, within 2 weeks, have game at least running.

## What I've done this week ##
I've worked a little bit in the repository fixing up some compiler errors.
I also contacted someone I knew at the Center for Game Science and received
the Haxe version of their common library that some classes have a dependency
on for audio and likely, in the future, logging and internationalization. I set
up the Trello board for the project and have continued assisting others get
started in the codebase and helping out where needed.

## Next week's goals ##
I definitely want to get more involved in the codebase than I have been. I would
like to see it up and running in some state or another within the next week, but
I have doubts as to the feasibility of that plan. We'll chat some more of what
the final architecture should look like now that everyone has had a little bit
of experience in the codebase.
