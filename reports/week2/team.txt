# Team Report: Week 2 #


## Progress ##
Our progress this week was primarily focused on organizing the logistics of the
project. We discussed the scope of the work to determine what aspects we want
to focus on, and which we think would be doable in our timeframe. Additionally,
we reviewed the written report of the original Pipe Jam game to get an
understanding of how verifications games work and how this specific game is
structured.

We were not able to access any code for the Pipe Jam game, and also had
difficulty accessing playable versions of the game due to expired web pages and
because of Flash players being decomissioned in modern brower versions.


## Goals ##
- Acquire existing codebase
- Set up project development environment
- Re-assess project scope and timeframe projection using our new understanding
  of the codebase
