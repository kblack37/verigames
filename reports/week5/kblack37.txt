## Previous week's goals ##
I definitely want to get more involved in the codebase than I have been. I would
like to see it up and running in some state or another within the next week, but
I have doubts as to the feasibility of that plan. We'll chat some more of what
the final architecture should look like now that everyone has had a little bit
of experience in the codebase.

## What I've done this week ##
Worked in the PipeJam codebase fixing some compiler errors. Looked into replacing
the FZip dependency with the Haxe Zip API, but the two are dissimilar enough that
it'll take more than the cursory look I gave it to replace FZip. Led the team meeting.
Worked on the user manual.

## Next week's goals ##
Since FlowJam is now free of compiler errors, I definitely want to do the same for
the PipeJam code. Once those are up, we'll look into refactoring the assets interface
in the current codebase to use the OpenFL Asset API instead of the embedded resources
the Flash codebase used. Once that is up, there's likely some other sneaky errors that
weren't caught by the compiler that we'll have to fix (since Haxe isn't statically typed)
but hopefully we can have the games running by next Monday.
