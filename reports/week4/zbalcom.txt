I began this project a step or two behind my coworkers due to persistent issues from last quarter. Because of this, my goals for this week (despite my lack of previous status report) were to get acquainted with the tools we are using to debug and expand the PipeJam and FlowJam games, and to reach a point of understanding at which I can begin debugging and fixing the project code independently.

Since that time, I have met with my group members and have been able to download all of our tools, access the code base, and begin debugging independently. I have been able to fix a few minor bugs in the code via trial, error, and Google searches. However, I am not yet familiar enough with the Haxe programming language we are using and its associated tools to function fully autonomously on this team, and my goals for this week reflect that.


For this upcoming week, my goal will be to learn the Haxe language and tools associated with it, specifically those used to convert our code base from its previous language, ActionScript. In this way I hope to become better-equipped to deal with some of the more unusual bugs and issues that have presented themselves in our Haxe code base, and fix a reasonable percentage of dependency and syntax errors caused by the converter. A “reasonable percentage” is to be determined, but as a preliminary estimate, I hope to have the PipeJam code bug-free (with the help of my team) in no more than two weeks, maximum.
