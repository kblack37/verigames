Next week I plan to work more on Flowjam and sepcifically working on why it displays nothing once targeted to html5. A lot of the port involved commenting out problematic code. I marked these with 
TODOs so they will be easy to find and work on.


I made good progress along with the team on making flowjam work, it now shows a loading bar before encountering a null pointer in the code which is a huge step. I also worked on the report this week to adress the changes that were recommended.

The plan for this week is to move ahread more on flowjam, Pipejam seems like it is a more complicated program than flowjam and will be more work than anticipated. The classes I thought would share similair code are at times completely different.
Pipejam will be worked on but I feel my priority is flowjam because I am more familiar with its code.
