## Previous week's goals ##
Since FlowJam is now free of compiler errors, I definitely want to do the same for
the PipeJam code. Once those are up, we'll look into refactoring the assets interface
in the current codebase to use the OpenFL Asset API instead of the embedded resources
the Flash codebase used. Once that is up, there's likely some other sneaky errors that
weren't caught by the compiler that we'll have to fix (since Haxe isn't statically typed)
but hopefully we can have the games running by next Monday.

## What I've done this week ##
Fixed many additional compiler errors in FlowJam after correcting the static entry point.
Refactored the AssetInterface class to use the new OpenFL Asset API. Worked on a few of
the aforementioned sneaky errors. Updated the architecture section of the proposal. Led
the team meeting. Delegated tasks.

## Next week's goals ##
Now that FlowJam is ACTUALLY free of compiler errors and can demonstrate the solutions to
many of the common compiler errors, I hope to also have PipeJam be in the same state by
next week. Want to finish cleaning up the FlowJam code so it doesn't crash immediately upon launch.
Integrate all the feedback we've gotten on the proposal & the user manual; this will likely
have to be delegated as it's easier to explain than the code errors.
